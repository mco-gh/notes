> For the second time, astronomers have detected a pattern in a mysterious fast radio burst coming from space. It repeats every 157 days and originates in a dwarf galaxy over 3 billion light-years away. FRBs are millisecond-long bursts of radio waves in space.

# Another mysterious radio burst in space is repeating a pattern. This one occurs every 157 days
