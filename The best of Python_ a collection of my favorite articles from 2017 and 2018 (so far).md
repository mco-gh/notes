The best of Python: a collection of my favorite articles from 2017 and 2018 (so far)

# The best of Python: a collection of my favorite articles from 2017 and 2018 (so far)

![](../_resources/d4cfd9d989a839fe02f011cd208df57f.png)![1*DxK6U9emVBkSotKCeyAyOw.jpeg](../_resources/1b74838a4c1b1b0017afe42fba8dbb12.jpg)

I divided the collected articles into 10 categories

### My intention with publishing this collection

Last year I only used Medium for **consuming content**, and I checked out a ton of Python-related articles. Recently I’ve started to use the **community*  *features **of the platform, for instance following fellow developers. I also developed the practice of clapping and highlighting the most interesting parts of their articles. **My goal is to be an active member** of the developer community gathered on Medium.

I also realized that I would like to **give back to the community **after reading so many great resources. This was one of my main motivations for writing my first article [“Why you need Python environments and how to manage them with Conda”](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c).

In this article, I’d like to share with you the **articles I found most interesting and insightful (inspiring) last year and this year (so far)**. My other goal was to create a comprehensive list of the most valuable pieces** for my Python students**.

### How to navigate this article

I bookmarked so many great resources that it was not easy to select the best ones. So I divided the article into** 10 categories** — this, by the way, resonates well with the **versatile and multipurpose nature of Python**.

The categories are:

#### 1.5 How — and why — you should use Python Generators, by [Radu Raicea](https://medium.com/@Radu_Raicea)

This tutorial showcases examples of an **iterator class** and different types of **generator functions**.

> “**> Generator functions**>  allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They allow programmers to make an iterator in a fast, easy, and clean way.”

> “An > [**> iterator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator)>  is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon. It is used to abstract a container of data to make it behave like an iterable object. You probably already use a few iterable objects every day: strings, lists, and dictionaries to name a few.”

In this post, Elior demystifies three **dimensionality reduction** techniques: **PCA, t-SNE, and Auto Encoders**.

> “The need to reduce dimensionality is often associated with visualizations (reducing to 2–3 dimensions so we can plot it) but that is not always the case. Sometimes we might value performance over precision so we could reduce 1,000 dimensional data to 10 dimensions so we can manipulate it faster (eg. calculate distances).”

#### 10.1 - 5 Quick and Easy Data Visualizations in Python with Code, by [George Seif](https://medium.com/@george.seif94)

This article contains a great chart that helps you select **the proper data visualization technique for a given situation**. Then it takes a closer look at six data visualization types and shows examples of using **Python’s Matplotlib **for creating these assets: two kinds of scatter plots, line plots, histograms, bar plots and box plots.
